## Bad Interface – Mouse Properties on Windows

- Objective of the interface
    - This window's objective is to change the mouse settings on the windows operating system. It's possible to change the look, movement speed, scroll settings, buttons settings, amongst other things.
- Bad aspects
    - This interface got two buttons ("apply" and "ok") that express an affirmative action without clear indicators of what each button does. From the looks of it "apply" always saves the settings in the current tab, but "ok" sometimes saves the settings in the current tab and closes the window, and other times saves the settings in all tabs and then closes the window. It's so bad not even [microsoft support](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/why-is-there-both-an-apply-button-and-an-ok-button/5540c79e-4cef-496f-9364-a8d25e761c0d) really knows what "ok" does. 
- Why it is bad?
    - This is bad because without a clear indicator of what each buttons does it leads an ineffective use of the interface, be it by performing extra clicks by clicking in both "apply" and "ok" to be sure the settings are applied, or by clicking just one of them and not getting the desired result.
- Why was it designed like that?
    - It probably was designed this way either as way to have a button to just save the current tab and a button to save all the tabs, or as a way to have a button that just saves and another one that saves and closes the window in order to save an extra click on close, but somewhere in the middle of development this ideas got mixed and the inconsistencies started.
- Improvement idea
    - They could change the text in the buttons to better reflect what each buttons do. For example they should change the "apply" to "save, and the "ok" to "save and exit", or the "ok" to "save all and exit" depending on the window. They could also move the "apply" button into the tab that it is going to save instead of it being at the bottom close to the other buttons, as way to better represent which settings are about to be saved, and not give the wrong idea that it's going to save the whole window.

## Good Interface – Camera App

- Objective of the interface
    - This app's purpose is to take pictures.
- Good aspects
    - The way we click on the place we intend to focus the camera.
- Why it is good?
    - This is a really smart way to present this interaction, since it's in our natural instinct to touch the things we are drawn to, and as such when looking through the preview window, if the thing we are trying to capture isn't focused most likely we are going to try and touch it and discover this is how you focus the camera.
