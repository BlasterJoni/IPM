## Good Interface – MIUI (Xiaomi) Calls Menu

- Objective of the interface
    - Make phone calls and see the call logs/history.

- Good aspects
    - As soon as the interface is opened, it shows the recent calls right away, which is excellent since most users always end up calling the same people. Besides that, a simple click in the telephone icon is all it takes to call someone that’s already at the top of the application.
    - There is a small button with a dial pad icon that anyone who wants to dial a number is intuitively going to click.
    - To search through the contacts quickly there’s a search bar at the top where basically anything can be written and a contact with the corresponding characteristics is going to be shown.
    - At the bottom of the app there’s a favorites and a contacts list shortcut that should be used if the contact is not in the recent calls and the user doesn’t feel like searching for it.
    - Last but not least, to open more information about a contact all there is to be done is just to click in the contact.
- Why it is good?
    - It’s a good interface since it makes the process of calling someone really easy - the user doesn’t need to read any instructions guide or to even think.

## Bad Interface – Xiaomi Android TV remote

- Objective of the interface
    - The main purpose of this remote is to control an Android TV.
- Bad aspects
    - This remote, as we can see in the picture, has four buttons at the bottom that, without reading the instruction manual, no one knows what they are for.   
- Why it is bad?
    - This is a negative aspect since the remote is a small object that contains few buttons for the amount of functionality that the Android TV can perform, and the fact that four of the few buttons are wasted in functions that most of the users don’t know exist is a waste of resources.
- Why was it designed like that?
    - In this kind of Android TVs there’s a lot of functionalities available and nowadays most designs are as simplicist as possible. The problem is that the designs are so simple that they end up jeopardizing the whole use of the TV remote's interface, since nobody knows what some buttons are for.
- Improvement idea
    - A easy way to better the interface would be to place functional icons in the buttons, instead of the more aesthetically pleasing shapes - in this way anyone would know what the buttons are for.
