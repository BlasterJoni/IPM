## Bad Example – SNS Site

 - This site’s objective is to contain all the relevant information related to SNS. In this site it’s possible to read news, obtain information about the available services and log into your account. 
 - The website is awfully cluttered, with too many pictures and a giant slideshow that occupies most of the screen as the site is entered. The login button is very small given the unnecessary logo attached to it. As for the search and language buttons they are not intuitive at all and I didn’t quite understand what they did before clicking them. 
 - The worst aspect of the site is that all the information is scattered around various pages that are very hard to find. This difficulty in obtaining the desired information makes for a very user-unfriendly site. 
 - To better the site I’d get rid of the unnecessary pictures and slideshow, better organize the top menu and change the log in, search and language buttons.

## Good Example – Blinkers

 - Blinkers are very important for accident avoidance as they are the easiest way to tell other drivers on the road when they are going to take a turn. 
 - Given their importance, it’s necessary that their usage is simplified as to better improve the driver’s experience and to encourage their use. 
 - Current blinker’s design is very used friendly and very efficient. By creating a “stick” that follows the turning of the steering wheel, it’s very intuitive for drivers to know where to move it and they don’t have to go out of their way to do it. Besides that, after turning, it returns to its neutral place of not blinking when the steering wheel is straightened.
